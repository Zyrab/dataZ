  "title": "Building a Space-Themed Home Page with a Mini-Game",
  "intro": "Two weeks ago, I decided to change the Home page. I chose space as the theme, and at first, I wanted to insert an interactive spaceship or a 3D planet. For this, I had to either use a library or learn WebGL. I didn’t want to use a library because I wanted everything on the website to be written by me. But I also didn’t have time to learn WebGL.\n\nIn the end, I decided to write a mini-game (though in hindsight, learning a bit of WebGL might have been a better choice).",

This means that if you draw 100 circles, and the frame rate is 60 FPS, you get 6,000 calculations per second. I ran a small experiment, trying to continuously draw around 200,000 circles, and the FPS dropped significantly. Other than this, I didn’t notice any issues with animations and gameplay, but on lower-end devices, this could be an issue. So, generating that many objects procedurally wasn’t a good idea."
